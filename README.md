# Brain-function
What is the brain? The brain is a complex organ that controls thought, memory, emotion, touch, motor skills, vision, breathing, temperature, hunger and every process that regulates our body.

The functional sections (lobes) of the brain are also categorized by side – the right side and the left side. If you split the brain down the middle into two equally-sized parts, they are not the same and do not carry the same functions. The right side of the brain controls the left side of the body, while the left side of the brain controls the right side of the body. Each side is responsible for different functions, and general patterns of dysfunction may occur depending on the side of the brain sustaining an injury.

The traits of each side are detailed below:Analytical
Logical
Precise
Organized
Detached
Literal
Injuries of the left side of the brain can cause:

Difficulties understanding language (receptive language)
Difficulties in speaking or verbal output (expressive language)
Catastrophic reactions (depression, anxiety)
Difficulty speaking
Impaired logic
Sequencing difficulties
Decreased control over right-sided body movements
Creative
Imaginative
Intuitive
Conceptual
Empathetic
Figurative
Injuries of the right side of the brain can cause:

Visual-spatial impairment
Visual memory deficits
Left neglect (inattention to the left side of the body)
Decreased awareness of deficits
Altered creativity and music perception
Loss of “the big picture” type of thinking
Decreased control over left-sided body movements

# My Portfolio Website

This is a personal portfolio website that showcases my work, skills, and experiences as a software developer. The website is designed to provide a visually appealing and user-friendly interface for visitors to navigate through my projects and learn more about me.

## Features

- **Home Page**: The home page provides a brief introduction about myself and highlights my key skills and expertise. It also includes a call-to-action section to encourage visitors to explore further.

- **Projects**: This section showcases a selection of my best projects. Each project is displayed with a thumbnail image, a short description, and a link to view more details. Visitors can easily browse through the projects and get a glimpse of my technical abilities.

- **Skills**: This page provides a detailed list of my technical skills and proficiencies. It includes programming languages, frameworks, tools, and methodologies that I am proficient in. This section helps potential employers or clients understand my technical expertise.

- **Experience**: This section outlines my professional experience, including previous job positions, internships, or freelance work. It includes details such as company names, job titles, and a brief description of my responsibilities and achievements in each role.

- **Contact**: The contact page provides visitors with a convenient way to get in touch with me. It includes a contact form where users can submit their inquiries or messages directly to my email address. Additionally, my social media profiles and professional networks are also provided for alternative contact methods.

## Technologies Used

- HTML5: Used for structuring the web pages and content.
- CSS3: Used for styling and layout of the website.
- JavaScript: Used for interactive features and dynamic content.
- Bootstrap: Utilized the Bootstrap framework for responsive design and pre-built components.
- GitHub Pages: Hosted the website on GitHub Pages for easy deployment and accessibility.

## Deployment

The website is deployed using GitHub Pages, which allows for easy hosting and sharing of static web pages directly from a GitHub repository. The repository contains all the necessary files and assets for the website, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and media files. Any updates or changes made to the repository will be automatically reflected on the live website.

## Conclusion

This portfolio website serves as a showcase of my skills, projects, and experiences in the field of software development. It is designed to provide an engaging and informative experience for visitors, allowing them to learn more about me and my work. The website is easily accessible through GitHub Pages and can be further customized and expanded as my portfolio grows.

What is the brain made of?
Weighing about 3 pounds in the average adult, the brain is about 60% fat. The remaining 40% is a combination of water, protein, carbohydrates and salts. The brain itself is a not a muscle. It contains blood vessels and nerves, including neurons and glial cells.

What is the gray matter and white matter?
Gray and white matter are two different regions of the central nervous system. In the brain, gray matter refers to the darker, outer portion, while white matter describes the lighter, inner section underneath. In the spinal cord, this order is reversed: The white matter is on the outside, and the gray matter sits within.
Gray matter is primarily composed of neuron somas (the round central cell bodies), and white matter is mostly made of axons (the long stems that connects neurons together) wrapped in myelin (a protective coating). The different composition of neuron parts is why the two appear as separate shades on certain scans.

How does the brain work?
The brain sends and receives chemical and electrical signals throughout the body. Different signals control different processes, and your brain interprets each. Some make you feel tired, for example, while others make you feel pain.

Some messages are kept within the brain, while others are relayed through the spine and across the body’s vast network of nerves to distant extremities. To do this, the central nervous system relies on billions of neurons (nerve cells).

Cerebrum
The cerebrum (front of brain) comprises gray matter (the cerebral cortex) and white matter at its center. The largest part of the brain, the cerebrum initiates and coordinates movement and regulates temperature. Other areas of the cerebrum enable speech, judgment, thinking and reasoning, problem-solving, emotions and learning. Other functions relate to vision, hearing, touch and other senses.

Cerebral Cortex
Cortex is Latin for “bark,” and describes the outer gray matter covering of the cerebrum. The cortex has a large surface area due to its folds, and comprises about half of the brain’s weight.

The cerebral cortex is divided into two halves, or hemispheres. It is covered with ridges (gyri) and folds (sulci). The two halves join at a large, deep sulcus (the interhemispheric fissure, AKA the medial longitudinal fissure) that runs from the front of the head to the back. The right hemisphere controls the left side of the body, and the left half controls the right side of the body. The two halves communicate with one another through a large, C-shaped structure of white matter and nerve pathways called the corpus callosum. The corpus callosum is in the center of the cerebrum.
