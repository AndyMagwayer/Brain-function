# Brain-function
What is the brain? The brain is a complex organ that controls thought, memory, emotion, touch, motor skills, vision, breathing, temperature, hunger and every process that regulates our body.

The functional sections (lobes) of the brain are also categorized by side – the right side and the left side. If you split the brain down the middle into two equally-sized parts, they are not the same and do not carry the same functions. The right side of the brain controls the left side of the body, while the left side of the brain controls the right side of the body. Each side is responsible for different functions, and general patterns of dysfunction may occur depending on the side of the brain sustaining an injury.

The traits of each side are detailed below:Analytical
Logical
Precise
Organized
Detached
Literal
Injuries of the left side of the brain can cause:

Difficulties understanding language (receptive language)
Difficulties in speaking or verbal output (expressive language)
Catastrophic reactions (depression, anxiety)
Difficulty speaking
Impaired logic
Sequencing difficulties
Decreased control over right-sided body movements
Creative
Imaginative
Intuitive
Conceptual
Empathetic
Figurative
Injuries of the right side of the brain can cause:

Visual-spatial impairment
Visual memory deficits
Left neglect (inattention to the left side of the body)
Decreased awareness of deficits
Altered creativity and music perception
Loss of “the big picture” type of thinking
Decreased control over left-sided body movements
